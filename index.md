INTRODUCTION

Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
the pitch.
{% endcomment %}

[ForBio](https://www.forbio.uio.no/) and [UiB](https://www.uib.no/) Dead Wood Meeting 2021 satellite workshops cover (1) managing interactions data and (2) analysis and visualization of interaction datasets. The goal is to introduce basics of current informatics methods in working with interaction data to students and researchers of dead wood systems.

During this two-day participatory workshop, students and researchers will explore the current informatics methods used to work with interaction data "in the wild." Our group exploration will cover data origins, data integration, data publishing, data analysis, and data visualization. 

In the morning sessions, [Dr. Dmitry Schigel](http://adlignum.com/about/) (Monday) and [Dr. Talya Hackett](https://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-talya-hackett#/) (Tuesday) share their insights on topics like constructing, publishing, analyzing, and visualizing interaction data.

In the afternoon sessions, [Jorrit Poelen](https://jhpoelen.nl) facilitates hands-on assignments on current informatics methods to publish and reuse interaction data as well as introduces ways to visualize interactions data. 

The workshop was conceived and organized by [Dr. Dmitry Schigel](http://adlignum.com/about/), Scientific Officer at Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, [https://gbif.org](https://gbif.org)). 

For more information about the ForBio and UiB Dead Wood 2021 Meeting see <a href="https://www.forbio.uio.no/events/courses/2021/Deadwood_2021">ForBio's announcement</a> and the <a href="http://adlignum.com/teaching/dead-wood-meeting-2021/">meeting agenda</a>.


This workshop is open to registered participants. 

The proposed outcomes of this workshop are a reusable Carpentries lesson and improved documentation on methods to integrate, access, and visualize biotic interaction data through participant-written blog posts. We will work together through a series of exploratory data exercises. No programming experience is required, and you will use your own device to download data. Everyone will contribute during this workshop. Bring snacks! :)

## Acknowledgments
A special thanks to the thousands of (citizen) scientists and their institutions for openly sharing their [datasets](https://globalbioticinteractions.org/sources). Also, thanks to the thousands of software engineers who provide the high-quality open source software on which GloBI, GBIF, and other biodiversity infrastructures are built. 

The symposium is organized by ForBio and University Museum of Bergen, with the support from Lomonosov Moscow State University, the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, the University of Oslo, the Voronezhsky State Nature Biosphere Reserve, the University of Helsinki. Funding is provided by the [Directorate for Higher Education and Skills, Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research](https://hkdir.no/the-directorate-for-higher-education-and-skills) (formerly Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation and Quality Enhancement in Higher Education (Diku) and ForBio.

Finally, a big thanks to [Nataliya Budaeva](https://www.nataliyabudaeva.com) for coordinating workshop activities and logistics.

SCHEDULE

Show the workshop's schedule.

Small changes to the schedule can be made by modifying the
`schedule.html` found in the `_includes` folder for your
workshop type (`swc`, `lc`, or `dc`). Edit the items and
times in the table to match your plans. You may also want to
change 'Day 1' and 'Day 2' to be actual dates or days of the
week.

For larger changes, a blank template for a 4-day workshop
(useful for online teaching for instance) can be found in
`_includes/custom-schedule.html`. Add the times, and what
you will be teaching to this file. You may also want to add
rows to the table if you wish to break down the schedule
further. To use this custom schedule here, replace the block
of code below the Schedule `<h2>` header below with
`{% include custom-schedule.html %}`.
