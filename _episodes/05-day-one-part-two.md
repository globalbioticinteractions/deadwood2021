title: "Day One Group Assignment Part Two"
teaching: 20
exercises: 55
questions:
- "How to find any kind of species interaction dataset?"
- "How to make it easier to review of interaction datasets?"
- "How facilitate interaction data access?"
objectives:
- "Articulate challenges of sharing, reviewing, and reuse interaction datasets"
- "Discover alternate ways to share, review, and reuse interaction data"
keypoints:
- "Automated taxonomic name linking facilitates discovery, review, and interpretation, of interaction records"
- "Keeping track of data provenance/origins can be tricky" 
- "Specialized search indexes like GloBI can help facilitate data discovery" 
- "Automated linking and index processes are likely imperfect and subjective"

Earlier, we've had a close look at individual interaction descriptions. Also, we collaborated to review existing species interaction datasets. 

Now, we'll look into ways to help facilitate ways to share, find, and analyze, species interaction datasets. 

The main focus of these exercises is https://globalbioticinteractions.org , but note that other projects like [Mangal](https://mangal.io), [Web of Life](https://web-of-life.es), [Interaction Web Database Data](https://iwdb.nceas.ucsb.edu/resources.html) also aim to make species interaction data easier to find and reuse.

In the 75 minutes afternoon session, we'll quickly go over some available workshop sections. 

Then, rather than trying to do all of them in this afternoon, we can vote on which one to do first, then time permitting we can repeat the exercise for the remaining parts. 

If you'd like, the sections will be available after the workshop for independent work.

The following sections are available (slightly adapted from a [previous workshop](https://globalbioticinteractions.org/interaction-data-workshop) by Katja Seltmann and Jorrit Poelen in context of the https://parasitetracker.org project.

 * [Getting Interaction Data](../06-getting-data) (~10 mins)
 * [Exploring Species Interaction Records By Pointing and Clicking](../08-point-and-click) (~30 mins)
 * [Working with the Whole (GloBI) Dataset](../07-whole-dataset) (~30 mins)
 * [Working with Data Sources](../09-data-sources) (~20 mins)
 * [Taxonomic Name Review](../10-taxonomic-name-review) (~20 mins)
 * [Interaction Data Record Review](../11-interaction-data-record-review) (~20 mins)

> 1. Go to the [collaborative meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17CYNNt0YA5QOQwdXCPsVjJgcsPJ5834ycnmMIoM0b5A/edit#heading=h.wujgaohm9tze) section `selecting afternoon schedule`

> 2. Vote by adding +1's to the items you'd like to do as a group
>
> 3. We'll do as many episodes as we can until 16:30 
>
> 4. We'll continue to take notes collaboratively, to ask questions, share insights.

Please feel free to revisit the episodes we covered, and ask engage in discussion with fellow participants or meeting organizers. Also, episodes that we did not get to will be available for your to explore
